ORAL QUESTIONS FROM MACHINE LEARNING AND PATTERN RECOGNITION
This are the questions that were asked in the first 3 oral sessions, feel free to add and modify this file
Remember that the questions will be mostly on the parts of the project that are incorrect.

1. What are your contributions to the project
2. Summarize what you did in the project
3. How could you implement non - linear models, how would you use and make work non linear model
4. normalization changes PCA directions?
5. what PCA is doing?how do you compute PCA
7. DCF how to compute
8. what are generitive approaches?
9. SVM how to use it non linearly
10. What we use to estimate the parameters for a guassian distribution in a MVG
11. What is the loglikelihood ratio?
12. How do you obtain the threshold from the training data
13. Assumption made from the logistic regression model
14. How the logistic regression model works and what is the function we are trying to minimize?
15. How do you train the gaussian classifier model?
16. How LDA works, assumptions and limitations.
17. What rank is the within covariance matrix?
18. GMM what they are?
19. Relationship between LDA and tied gaussian covariance classifier
20. SVM in general how do they work how to make them non linear
21. How do you train a GMM, what do they achieve and how do they work
22. What we do when we apply the EM algorithm
23. What are responsibilities
24. How accuracy and DCF are related
25. How did you apply kfold to compute the minDCF
26. What are the menaing of SVM primal and dual solutions?
27. What the hyperparameters in SVM represent?
28. How do you calculate actual DCF and what we use it for?
